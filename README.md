LAWN is a cross-platform Learning Management System that helps students, teachers, and administration keep all learning materials (homework, educational resources, schedule, etc) in one place.

The System has 3 main sections:
1. **Schedule** â€“ subjects are arranged by days and order during the day. Raws of subjects are scrollable horizontally. </br>
